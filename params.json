{"name":"FAMILIAR project","tagline":"feature models, variability, software product lines, configuration, domain-specific language, automated reasoning, model-driven engineering","body":"**FAMILIAR** (for FeAture Model scrIpt Language for manIpulation and Automatic Reasoning) is a language for importing, exporting, composing, decomposing, editing, configuring, computing \"diffs\", refactoring, reverse engineering, testing, and reasoning about (multiple) feature models. All these operations can be combined to realize complex variability management tasks ([screencast/demonstration](http://mathieuacher.com/pub/VSModular/)).\r\n\r\nFAMILIAR was originally created at [I3S laboratory](http://www.i3s.unice.fr) by [Mathieu Acher](http://mathieuacher.com/), [Philippe Collet](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~collet/) and [Philippe Lahire](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~lahire/english/E-index.html) and is now jointly and openly managed by the [Triskell](http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/) team (INRIA / IRISA / University of Rennes 1), the [MODALIS](http://modalis.polytech.unice.fr/) team (I3S laboratory, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis) and at [Colorado State University](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/) (USA).\r\n\r\n## News\r\n\r\n * We are migrating to github and the repos/pages will be regularly updated in the next few days \r\n * SCP journal paper about FAMILIAR is in press\r\n * FAMILIAR was part of a tutorial at  Software Product Line Conference 2012 (SPLC'12)\r\n * FAMILIAR was part of a tutorial at  International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages & Systems (MODELS'12)\r\n * FAMILIAR was at  ASE'11 conference for a tool demonstration and short paper presentation.

Meanwhile, you can play with FAMILIAR following the instructions located here: \r\n\r\nhttps://nyx.unice.fr/projects/familiar/wiki/readme\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Overview\r\n\r\nFeature models are a popular formalism for managing variability in software product lines (SPLs). Realistic SPLs involve the modeling of a large number of features to comprehensively represent different viewpoints, sub-systems or concerns of the software system. To manage complexity, there is a need to separate, inter-relate and compose several feature models while automating the reasoning on their compositions -- from validity checks to configuration process. We propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that is dedicated to the management of feature models and that complements existing tool support.\r\n\r\nThe DSL, called FAMILIAR (for FeAture Model scrIpt Language for manIpulation and Automatic Reasoning), is an executable language that supports manipulating and reasoning about feature models. FAMILIAR is developed in Java language using  Xtext, a framework for development of DSLs. Off-the-shelf SAT solvers (i.e., SAT4J) and BDD library (i.e., JavaBDD) are internally used to perform FAMILIAR operations.\r\nAn interpreter can be used in an interactive mode. We provide multiple notations for specifying feature models (SPLOT,  GUIDSL/FeatureIDE, a subset of  TVL, etc.) \r\n\r\nWe provide different solutions for using FAMILIAR:\r\n * FAMILIAR Tool, fully integrated modeling standalone app that can be executed as JAR file.\r\n * A plugin for the Eclipse platform, integrated with Xtext and FeatureIDE ;\r\n * Another standalone version that supports console mode only.\r\n \r\nHave a look at the screencasts that demonstrate FAMILIAR in the different environments.
