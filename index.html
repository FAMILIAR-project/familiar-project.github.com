        <h1>Welcome to FAMILIAR project!</h1>

<p>FAMILIAR (for FeAture Model scrIpt Language for manIpulation and Automatic Reasoning) is a language for importing, exporting, composing, decomposing, editing, configuring, computing "diffs", refactoring, reverse engineering, and reasoning about (multiple) feature models. All these operations can be combined to realize complex variability management tasks (see a [<a href="http://mathieuacher.com/pub/VSModular/">http://mathieuacher.com/pub/VSModular/</a> demonstration])</p>

<p>FAMILIAR is developed in the Triskell team (INRIA / IRISA / University of Rennes 1), in the MODALIS team (I3S laboratory, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis) and at Colorado State University (USA).</p>

<h2>Motivation and Overview</h2>

<p>Feature models are a popular formalism for managing variability in software product lines (SPLs). Realistic SPLs involve the modeling of a large number of features to comprehensively represent different viewpoints, sub-systems or concerns of the software system. To manage complexity, there is a need to separate, inter-relate and compose several feature models while automating the reasoning on their compositions -- from validity checks to configuration process. We propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that is dedicated to the management of feature models and that complements existing tool support.</p>

<p>The DSL, called FAMILIAR (for FeAture Model scrIpt Language for manIpulation and Automatic Reasoning), is an executable language that supports manipulating and reasoning about feature models. FAMILIAR is developed in Java language using  Xtext, a framework for development of DSLs. Off-the-shelf SAT solvers (i.e., SAT4J) and BDD library (i.e., JavaBDD) are internally used to perform FAMILIAR operations.
An interpreter can be used in an interactive mode. We provide multiple notations for specifying feature models (SPLOT,  GUIDSL/FeatureIDE, a subset of  TVL, etc.) </p>

<p>We provide different solutions for using FAMILIAR:</p>

<ul>
<li>FAMILIAR Tool, fully integrated modeling standalone app that can be executed as JAR file.</li>
<li>A plugin for the Eclipse platform, integrated with Xtext and FeatureIDE ;</li>
<li>Another standalone version that supports console mode only.</li>
</ul><p>Have a look at the screencasts that demonstrate FAMILIAR in the different environments. Do not hesitate to contact us in case of questions or other requests.</p>
